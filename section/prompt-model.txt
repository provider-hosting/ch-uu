When other characters appear besides the main model, use different hair colors and outfits unless they wear the same uniform. The main model is the service provider. The customer must be clearly visible, centered, and naturally receiving the service. Focus on realistic interaction and emphasize the service over the individuals. Use the [Scene] text to guide the service type and mood. Create a professional, high-quality, and fitting setting.
